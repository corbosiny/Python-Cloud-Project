# Python-Cloud-Project
Uses sockets in python to send files over TCP protocol 
to a multi-threaded server you can have running on a simple raspberry pi 
and a forwarded port on your home network or linked with a domain name.

Mainly just a mess around project to get socket experience and end up
with a nice little server for myself and some custom libraries for
any future project of mine!
